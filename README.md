Completed the assignment project Dashboard.

## Frontend:

- Reactjs, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN/Ui, React Context for state management.
- be at your root directory then,
- cd frontend
- cd dashboard
- npm install, To install all the necessary packages and dependencies.
- npm run dev, will start React client at http://localhost:5173

## Backend:

- Node JS, Javascript, Express JS.
- Split your terminals and be at your root directory then,
- cd backend
- npm install, To install all the necessary packages and dependencies.
- npm run dev, will start Node server at http://localhost:8000

## Context;

- I used Typescript for typesafety in React as more complex components are to be integrated which can generate major problems in future, if the same project scales with large number of components. and Javascript for the Node backend because there was no complexity with the backend as per the current requirements for the task assigned to me.
